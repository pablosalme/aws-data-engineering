### The evolution of data architectures
###### Application architecture evolved into more distributed systems.
1. Companies used on-premises mainframes to handle their critical apps.
2. Then apps were split into pieces using a client-server architecture, the server would respond to requests from various clients.
3. The three-tier architecture became prominent, apps were split into groups by functions.
	1. Presentation tier served as the user interface.
	2. Application tier handled the business logic and processing.
	3. Data tier provided longterm, persistent storage.
4. Cloud-based microservices, split your app into different services based on functionality.
###### Data stores evolved to handle a greater variety of data.
